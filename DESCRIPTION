Description: The package facilitates querying data from the ‘Facebook Marketing’ API, particularly for social science research <[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/]https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/>. Facebook marketing data has been used for a variety of social science applications, such as for poverty estimation (Marty and Duhaut (2024) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49564-6>), disease surveillance (Araujo et al. (2017) <arXiv:1705.04045>), and measuring migration (Alexander, Polimis, and Zagheni (2020) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-020-09599-3>). The package facilitates querying the number of Facebook daily/monthly active users for multiple location types (e.g., from around a specific coordinate to an administrative region) and for a number of attribute types (e.g., interests, behaviors, education level, etc). The package supports making complex queries within one API call and making multiple API calls across different locations and/or parameters.
